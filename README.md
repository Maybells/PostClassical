# Post-Classical Library
Although much attention is given to the authors of the Classical period, from Cicero to Vergil to Gellius, classical texts are outnumbered by post-classical texts by several orders of magnitude. This website is intended to help prospective post-classicalists find their way through a corpus of almost 50,000 books dating from the 1400's all the way to the present day.
